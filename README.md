# XSS Honeypot – Project Goal

This project is a high-interaction web honeypot designed to capture and study
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

Objectives:
- Build a deliberately vulnerable web application
- Attract and accept XSS payloads
- Log attacker input, IP, user-agent, and time
- Store payloads for later analysis
- Study real-world XSS techniques

Why this matters:
XSS is one of the most common web vulnerabilities. By observing how attackers
actually exploit it, I can better understand:
- Attacker mindset
- Common payload patterns
- How real attacks differ from textbooks
